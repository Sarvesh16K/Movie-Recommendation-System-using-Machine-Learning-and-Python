# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning-and-Python
Nowadays, the recommendation system has made finding the things easy that we need.
Movie recommendation systems aim at helping movie enthusiasts by suggesting what movie to watch without having to go through the long process of choosing from a large set of movies which go up to thousands and millions that is time consuming and confusing. 
To handle such problems, we introduced a model combining both content-based and collaborative approach. 
It will give progressively explicit outcomes compared to different systems that are based on various approach. 
Hence, we have focused on a system that resolves these issues.
# Movie Recommendation System Project using ML
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This project is designed to help you understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. We will be developing an Item Based Content Filter.
# What is a Recommendation System?
Simply put a Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
In the field of machine learning, classification methods which use different strategies to organize and classify data. Classifiers could possibly require training data. 
1. Collaborative filtering 
2. Content-based filtering 
3. Multi-criteria recommender systems 
4. Risk-aware recommender systems 
5. Mobile recommender systems 
6. Hybrid recommender systems

# Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric that measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The smaller the angle between the two vectors, the more similar they are to each other.
# Count Vectorizer
CountVectorizer is a great tool provided by the scikit-learn library in Python. It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text.
